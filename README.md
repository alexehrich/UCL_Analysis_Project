# My First Data Analysis Project

This is the Data Analysis final project. This project implements different tools learned during these weeks with the final goal of visualising some data, previously selected, and analyze those obtained results. To reach the final goal, some instructions have been followed to keep a clear and ordered pace until obtaining the final result.

All the goals of this project, could be summarized into the following:
* Identify and choose a dataset from Internet, which has some relevance to our own interests.
* Creating and using an ETL Script to treat the data from the chosen dataset.
* Create visual representations of the chosen data and analyze the obtained results, by applying visualisation tools.
* Creating a report (this one) that shows and proves all the executed steps and obtained results for this project.
